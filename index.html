            jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on
            your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many
            lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods
            that you can call with a single line of code.
          </p>
          <p>
            jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from
            JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation. The jQuery library
            contains the following features:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML/DOM manipulation</li>
            <li>CSS manipulation</li>
            <li>HTML event methods</li>
            <li>Effects and animations</li>

            jQuery was originally created in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by John
            Resig, influenced by Dean Edwards' earlier cssQuery library. It is
            currently maintained by a team of developers led by Timmy Willison
            (with the jQuery selector engine, Sizzle, being led by Richard
            Gibson).
          </p>
          <p>
            jQuery was originally licensed under the CC BY-SA 2.5, and
            relicensed to the MIT license in 2006. At the end of 2006, it was
            dual-licensed under GPL and MIT licenses.[14] As this led to some
            confusion, in 2012 the GPL was dropped and is now only licensed
            under the MIT license.

              (according to BuiltWith), and 17% of all Internet websites.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 2017, jQuery was used on 69.2% of the top 1 million websites
              (according to Libscore).

            <li>
              In 2018, jQuery was used on 73% of the top 1 million websites, and
              by 22.4% of all websites (according to BuiltWith).
            </li>

              As of May 2019, jQuery is used by 73% of the 10 million most

        <div class="desc">
          <p>
            The jQuery library is typically distributed as a single JavaScript
            file that defines all its interfaces, including DOM, Events, and
            Ajax functions. It can be included within a Web page by linking to a
            local copy, or by linking to one of the many copies available from
            public servers. jQuery has a content delivery network (CDN) hosted
            by MaxCDN. Google in Google Hosted Libraries service and Microsoft
            host the library as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example of linking a copy of the library locally (from the same
            server that hosts the Web page):
          </p>
          <pre class="code"><span></span><span
               class="p">&lt;</span
                ><span
                class="nt">script</span
                > <span class="na">src</span
                ><span class="o">=</span
                ><span class="s">"jquery.js"</span
                ><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span
                ><span class="nt">script</span
                ><span class="p">&gt;</span>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Example of linking a copy of the library from jQuery's public CDN:
          </p>
          <pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span
            > <span class="na">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"</span><span class="na">

          <h4>Functions</h4>
          <p>
            jQuery provides two kinds of functions, static utility functions and
            jQuery object methods. Each has its own usage style.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both are accessed through jQuery's main identifier: jQuery. This
            identifier has an alias named. All functions can be accessed through
            either of these two names.
          </p>
          <h5>jQuery methods</h5>
          <p>
            The jQuery function is a factory for creating a jQuery object that
            represents one or more DOM nodes. jQuery objects have methods to
            manipulate these nodes. These methods (sometimes called commands),
            are chainable as each method also returns a jQuery object.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access to and manipulation of multiple DOM nodes in jQuery typically
            begins with calling the $ function with a CSS selector string. This
            returns a jQuery object referencing all the matching elements in the
            HTML page. $("div.test"), for example, returns a jQuery object with
            all the div elements of class test. This node set can be manipulated
            by calling methods on the returned jQuery object.

        <div class="desc">
          <p>
            jQuery's architecture allows developers to create plug-in code to
            extend its function. There are thousands of jQuery plug-ins
            available on the Web that cover a range of functions, such as Ajax
            helpers, Web services, datagrids, dynamic lists, XML and XSLT tools,
            drag and drop, events, cookie handling, and modal windows.
          </p>
          <p>
            An important source of jQuery plug-ins is the plugins sub-domain of
            the jQuery Project website.[26] The plugins in this subdomain,
            however, were accidentally deleted in December 2011 in an attempt to
            rid the site of spam. The new site is a GitHub-hosted repository,
            which required developers to resubmit their plugins and to conform
            to new submission requirements.[28] jQuery provides a "Learning
            Center" that can help users understand JavaScript and get started
            developing jQuery plugins.
